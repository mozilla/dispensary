# Dispensary ðŸŒ¿

The dispensary collects and offers hashes of popular JavaScript libraries, mainly for the [Mozilla's addons-linter](https://github.com/mozilla/addons-linter).

## Libraries updates

This is the (manual) process to update libraries in dispensary:

1. Open `src/libraries.json`
2. Open the release pages of each library. Here is a list:

<!--RELEASE_PAGES_START-->

- https://github.com/angular/angular.js/releases
- https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/releases
- https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases
- https://download.dojotoolkit.org/
- https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/releases
- https://github.com/jquery/jquery/releases
- https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/releases
- https://github.com/moment/moment/releases
- https://github.com/mootools/mootools-core/releases
- http://prototypejs.org/
- https://github.com/facebook/react/releases
- https://github.com/jashkenas/underscore/releases
- https://github.com/mozilla/webextension-polyfill/releases

<!--RELEASE_PAGES_END-->

3. On each page, check whether there are newer release versions than what is in `src/libraries.json`. Note that some libraries, like react, support several versions, so we need to check each "branch".
4. For major upgrades, take a quick look at the code changes
5. Add new versions to `src/libraries.json`
6. Run `npm run update`
7. Commit and push (Make sure to include `src/libraries.json`and `src/hashes.txt`)
8. Tag and release

## Development commands

Here are some commands you can run:

### `npm run build`

This command builds the project.

### `npm run clean`

This command removes the build artifacts.

### `npm run eslint`

This command runs [eslint][] (JavaScript linter).

### `npm run prettier`

This command runs [pretty-quick][] to automatically compare and format modified source files against the master branch.

### `npm run prettier-full`

This command runs [Prettier][] to automatically format the entire codebase.

### `npm run prettier-ci`

This command runs [Prettier][] and fail if some code has been changed without being formatted.

### `npm run test`

This command builds the project and then runs the test suite (in watch mode).

### `npm run test-coverage`

This command builds the project, runs the test suite and then reports code coverage (codecov).

### `npm run test-ci`

This command runs all checks and is only useful in a CI context.

### `bin/build-doc`

This command updates the list of release pages in the `README.md` file based on the `src/libraries.json` file.
